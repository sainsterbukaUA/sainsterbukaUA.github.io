On Friday, 3 May 2019, Airlangga #OpenScience was formally established. Thank you to [Jurnal Administrasi Kesehatan Indonesia (JAKI)](https://e-journal.unair.ac.id/jaki) for hosting the event! JAKI recently launched their English version and invited Pak [Dasapta Erwin Irawan](https://dasaptaerwin.net) to give a talk on the introduction of #OpenScience at the event. This event marked an important milestone for the #OpenScience movement at Universitas Airlangga.

We are excited to continue our campaign in Universitas Airlangga and beyond!

This is our slides introducing [Airlangga #OpenScience](../files/Perkenalan.pdf).
