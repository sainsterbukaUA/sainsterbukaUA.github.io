On Friday, 3 May 2019, Airlangga #OpenScience has formally established. Thanks to [Jurnal Administrasi Kesehatan Indonesia (JAKI)](https://e-journal.unair.ac.id/jaki) for hosting the event! JAKI just launched their English version and hosted an event where pak [Dasapta Erwin Irawan](https://dasaptaerwin.net) was invited to give a talk about the Introduction of #OpenScience. The event set an important landmark for the #OpenScience movement in Universitas Airlangga.

We are excited to continue our campaign in Universitas Airlangga and beyond!

This is our slides introducing [Airlangga #OpenScience](../files/Perkenalan.pdf).
