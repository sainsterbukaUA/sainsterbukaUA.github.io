      <description>Publication Bias Webinar (Monday, 18 August 2019, 10.00 WIB/13.00 AEST) Aims This webinar aimed to familiarise Indonesian researchers with publication bias and meta-research. Systematic review and meta-analysis are rarely seen in Indonesian scientific discourse, while those might offer a better evidence and insight than a single study. By organising this webinar, we hoped to cover some introductory questions related to publication bias which are including:

      <description>On Friday, 3 May 2019, Airlangga #OpenScience has formally established. Thanks to Jurnal Administrasi Kesehatan Indonesia (JAKI) for hosting the event! JAKI just launched their English version and hosted an event where pak Dasapta Erwin Irawan was invited to give a talk about the Introduction of #OpenScience. The event set an important landmark for the #OpenScience movement in Universitas Airlangga.
We are excited to continue our campaign in Universitas Airlangga and beyond!</description>
